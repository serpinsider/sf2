      question: "What's the difference between a standard clean and a deep clean?",
      answer: "Our deep cleans include everything in a standard clean plus wiping down doors, door frames, windowsills, window frames, and baseboards. We spend extra time on detailed scrubbing and getting into areas that don't get regular attention."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a deep clean take?",
      answer: "A deep clean typically takes 4-8 hours depending on the size of your home and its condition. We'll give you an accurate time estimate when you book."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be home during the deep clean?",
      answer: "No, as long as our team can get in on their own, they can complete the clean and leave. Many customers prefer to be out while we work."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do to prepare for a deep clean?",
      answer: "Please pick up any clutter, secure any valuables, and let us know about any areas that need special attention. We'll handle the rest!"
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I get a deep clean?",
      answer: "We recommend a deep clean 2-4 times per year, or seasonally. Many customers book deep cleans in spring and fall, or before/after major holidays."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you bring your own supplies?",
      answer: "Yes, we use pet-safe and non-toxic products. We bring our own mops and vacuum (upon request)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you clean my fridge, microwave, and oven?",
      answer: "Yes! These are available as add-ons. Inside fridge, inside oven, and microwave cleaning can be added to any deep clean."
    },
    {
      question: "What areas do you serve?",
      answer: "**San Jose & Silicon Valley:**\n• San Jose: Downtown, Willow Glen, Almaden, Evergreen, Berryessa, Cambrian, Rose Garden\n• Santa Clara County: Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Mountain View, Milpitas, Campbell, Los Gatos, Saratoga\n• Surrounding Areas: Palo Alto, Fremont, Newark, Union City\n\nContact us to confirm service in your area."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer recurring deep clean discounts?",
      answer: "Yes! Save 10% with weekly service, 5% with bi-weekly service, or $10 off monthly cleanings."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
